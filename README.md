This is my Portfolio website.
Currently, it is done with html, css and js.
But, given that IÂ´m studying React.js, I decide to improve it.
So, at first, this is a website, that fetch all my jobs from a json file (You will find it on ## public/jobs/jobs.json ##)
But, when this is finished, it will be use a MySql database to fetch everything.



# The project has the frontend and the backend encapsulatio.
# This is for practice, this is for fun, this is to learn, this is to master React.

It is easy to understand.
But soon, it will have a doc.



# React + Vite
